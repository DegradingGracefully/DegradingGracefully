Hi. Manuel from France here. I'm a "full-stack" developer, but having done more backend work than front so far.

__Backend:__ Actually I enjoy developing backend MVC apps in Java, eg a good combo is:
* Model (Hibernate)
* View (JSON, or even XML through SOAP had some interesting things going for it)
* Controller (REST APIs through Spring MVC)

And I enjoy writing batches when I can make them elegant too.

Meanwhile, I've just started exploring Kotlin, that I may use someday to program some desktop apps with JavaFX.

__Frontend__: I also appreciate some stuff in javascript. Namely I find the functional idioms, the whole map(), filter(), reduce() functions nicely readable.

As for the frameworks, React and Angular seem like solid options, but currently focusing on the lighter (which also means a little bit less features) Svelte JS.

Cheers.
